I've completed the requested changes:

1.  **Profile Page Animations:**
    *   Slowed down the profile card animation to `duration-1000`.
    *   Added floating animations (`slide-in-from-bottom-8`) to the "Basic Info" and "Security Settings" cards with staggered delays (`delay-150`, `delay-300`) for a smoother, consistent feel.

2.  **Reservations Page Fix:**
    *   Removed the duplicate status bar (header) from the reservation details page (`/reservations/[id]`).
